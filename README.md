# EventBusCalculator
Simple Calculator (Delphi, FMX, EventBus, Expression Engine)

### Sample Project to demostrate the principles of :-

* [EventBus "a publish/subscribe Event Bus framework for the Delphi platform"](https://github.com/spinettaro/delphi-event-bus)
* [LiveBindings Expression Engine](https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2021-may-delphi-expression-engine.html)
* uses Regexp to ensure the Expression passed to the Exprssion engine is valid.



UI based on C++ Builder Calculator sample in https://github.com/Embarcadero/Blogs.git

#### Notes
* Authored in Delphi 10.4 Community edition [Download here](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/free-download/). (Probably works on previous versions)
* EventBus available from __Getit__ in the Delphi IDE or [here](https://github.com/spinettaro/delphi-event-bus).
* Expression engine is part of Delphi's Live bindings.
* Regexp is Part of Delphi.

#### Please note 
developed as a Win32/64 using FMX.
This is a sample project used to showcase without clutter. Main idea is to bring together a number of good technologies. I believe that the simplest and most effective way was thru' a calculator program. Can be used as a starting point to create a more robust working version.
